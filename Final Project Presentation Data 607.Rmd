## Introduction

**Context:**

* The NBA has transformed over the past two decades, largely driven by analytics.
* The Houston Rockets famously pioneered a data-driven focus on the 3-point shot.
* Our project analyzes three-point trends and their relationship with win percentage from **2000–2024**.
* Focus: Data preparation > Analysis.

## Data Sources

* 📊 **Basketball-Reference.com**

  * Team-level 3P stats by season 
  
* 🔗 **NBA API or HTML tables**

  * Team wins, losses, and win percentages (parsed from JSON or HTML).
  
## Project Goals

* Track league-wide changes in:

  * 3-point **volume** (3PA)
  * 3-point **accuracy** (3P%)
* Investigate how these relate to **team success** (win percentage).
* Emphasize data wrangling, merging, and tidying over statistical complexity.
* Focus on **data acquisition and preparation**, not just analysis.

```{r}
nba <- nba %>%
  mutate(
    # Win margin = total wins minus total losses
    WinMargin = WINS - LOSSES,
    
    # 3-point make rate = total made 3s divided by total attempted 3s
    # Should be approximately equal to the FG3_PCT column
    FG3M_Rate = FG3M_total / FG3A_total,
    
    # 3-point makes per win: shows how reliant a team was on 3s for its victories
    FG3M_per_Win = ifelse(WINS > 0, FG3M_total / WINS, NA)  # avoid divide-by-zero
  )
```

```{r}
## Compute Relative-to-League-Average Metrics(per season)

# These show how each team compares to the league average in that same season

nba <- nba %>%
  group_by(Season) %>%
  mutate(
    FG3A_rel_to_avg = FG3A_total - mean(FG3A_total, na.rm = TRUE),
    FG3_PCT_rel_to_avg = FG3_PCT - mean(FG3_PCT, na.rm = TRUE),
    WinPCT_rel_to_avg = WinPCT - mean(WinPCT, na.rm = TRUE)
  ) %>%
  ungroup()
```

```{r}
# Year-over-Year Changes by Team

# This helps analyze how teams are evolving over time
 nba <- nba %>%
  arrange(TeamName, Season) %>%
  group_by(TeamName) %>%
  mutate(
    FG3A_total_change = FG3A_total - lag(FG3A_total),
    WinPCT_change = WinPCT - lag(WinPCT)
  ) %>%
  ungroup()
```

```{r}
# Add Era Classification Buckets

# Manually classify NBA seasons into eras based on analytics usage

nba <- nba %>%
  mutate(
    Era = case_when(
      Season <= 2009 ~ "Pre-Analytics",
      Season <= 2014 ~ "Adoption",
      TRUE ~ "Revolution"
    )
  )
```

```

## Data Cleaning & Transformation

* **From Basketball-Reference:**
  * Scrape HTML tables (per season).
  * Clean column names, convert stats to numeric.
  * Add a “Season” column to track year-over-year data.

* **From NBA API:**

  * Extract JSON payload using `jsonlite::fromJSON()`.
  * Flatten nested lists into a dataframe with `purrr::map_df()` or `dplyr::bind_rows()`.
  * Keep key fields: `Team`, `Wins`, `Losses`, `Win%`.
  * Normalize team names to ensure proper joins.

* **Final Step:**

  * **Join** shooting and standings data by `Team` and `Season`.
  * Result: One **tidy dataframe** ready for plotting and regression.

## Why This Matters

* The assignment emphasizes **data preparation** as the core skill.
* Proper wrangling ensures accurate, reproducible insights.
* Clean data = Better models, better visualizations, better storytelling.

## Project Sharing

Title: Output and Sharing

* Code and report documented in RMarkdown
* Shared via:
  * RPubs (for public viewing)
  * GitHub (with full source and raw data)
* Tools used: rvest, jsonlite, dplyr, tidyverse, ggplot2

## NOTED

We visualized the relationship between 3-point shooting and team success using scatterplots and trend lines. A time-series plot showed the league-wide increase in 3-point attempts from 2000 to 2024. A second plot displayed how 3-point accuracy (FG3%) correlates more strongly with team win percentage than just the volume of 3-point shots attempted. These visuals helped us uncover patterns and test our hypothesis about the importance of shooting efficiency

The regression analysis showed that 3-point accuracy (FG3%) has a strong and statistically significant impact on team win percentage, while total 3-point attempts (FG3A_total) do not. This suggests that simply shooting more 3s doesn’t lead to winning—making them efficiently does. Our results highlight the importance of quality over quantity in modern NBA 3-point strategy.

## Conclusion

* The NBA's shift toward the 3-point shot is quantifiable and transformative.
* From 2000 to 2024, both volume and efficiency of 3-point shooting have increased steadily.
* Teams with higher 3-point attempt rates and shooting accuracy tend to win more games.
* Data preparation — cleaning, calculating relative metrics, and structuring by season — was key to uncovering these patterns.
* This approach mirrors the real-world strategies used by teams like the Houston Rockets, demonstrating the value of analytics in shaping outcomes.
